Problem/Issue to resolve: Being bored/Want to relax

We will be using a java game-development framework, named libGDX, to create this project. The intended usage is to create entertainment for users to enjoy. 

Our solution to this problem will be to create a game for people to enjoy playing:

The plan is to have a 2D game with a premise of going through 2 challenges.
Each challenge will be a different game mode: one will be a rhythm type of game, one will be a platformer. 
We have a player control a character, and they will traverse through these challenges, which will be the end of the game if the final challenge is complete. 

Operations for each intended user: 

WASD for character movement

Mouse for navigating through the screen

Spacebar for jumping

Arrow Key for rhythm game controls and space to speed up movement



How to run the code: 
After downloading from the GitHub link, on the right side of Intellij or using any IDE find and run the Gradle Project. 
Under ProjectH, navigate to desktop→Tasks→other→run
If there’s any JDK issues of any kind, select any that is 19 and above.
All images, maps, and audios are stored in the Assets folder.
Our code is contained under core, then src [main].
