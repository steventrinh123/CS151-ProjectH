Problem/Issue to resolve: Being bored/Want to relax

We will be using a java game-development framework, named libGDX [3], to create this project. The intended usage is to create entertainment for users to enjoy. 
We will also be using the Tiled map editor [4], the photopea editor [5], gimp [6], and wallpaperswide [7] for frontend purposes. 

Our solution to this problem will be to create a game for people to enjoy playing:

The plan is to have a 2D game with a premise of going through 2 challenges.
Each challenge will be a different game mode: one will be a rhythm type of game, one will be a platformer. 
We have a player control a character, and they will traverse through these challenges, which will be the end of the game if the final challenge is complete. 

Operations for each intended user: 

WASD for character movement

Mouse for navigating through the screen

Spacebar for jumping
