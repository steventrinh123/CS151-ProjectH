# CS151-ProjectH

Project Title: Project H
Team #: Group 5, Nagi Ebeid, Jerry Nguyen, Steven Trinh
Team Members working on proposal: Nagi, Jerry, Steven
Problem/Issue to resolve: Being bored/Want to relax
We will be using a java game engine, named libGDX to create this project, and the intended usage is to create entertainment for users to enjoy. 

Our solution to this problem will be to create a game:
The plan is to have a 2D game with a premise of going through 2 challenges
Each challenge will be a different game mode: one will be a rhythm type of game, one will be a platformer. 
We have a player control a character, and they will traverse through these challenges, which will be the end of the game if the final challenge is complete. 

Operations for each intended user: 

WASD for character movement

Mouse for navigating through the screen

Spacebar for jumping

Arrow Key for rhythm game controls

Space to speed up rhytm game
